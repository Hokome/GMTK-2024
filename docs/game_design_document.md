# Game Design Document

The theme of the jam is "Built to scale"

## Game Concept

Vampire survivors but you're a drum major (marching band leader) and your upgrades are musicians trailing behind you. Each band member attacks individually. They have their own vulnerable hurtbox but your max HP also scales with the amount of members. After obtaining a certain amount of XP from enemy drops, you get to choose between a selection of instruments to add to your band.

## Instruments

Ideas of what the instruments could do:

Bass drum: Large area attack around the musician

Snare drum: Small, high damage attacks that circle the musician

Cymbal: Long vertical hitbox

Steel drum: Small attacks moving horizontally

Tuba: Large long lasting hitbox

Trumpet: Small, slow projectiles that are shot in a spiral

Flute: Small high damage hitbox that flies randomly around the musician

Strings: Slowdown debuff

Keytar: Attack buff

Piano: Defense buff
