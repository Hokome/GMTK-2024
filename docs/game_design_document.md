# Game Design Document

The theme of the jam is "Built to scale"

## Game Concept

Vampire survivors but you're a drum major (marching band leader) and your upgrades are musicians trailing behind you. Each band member attacks individually. They have their own vulnerable hurtbox but your max HP also scales with the amount of members. After obtaining a certain amount of XP from enemy drops, you get to choose between a selection of instruments to add to your band.

## Instruments

Ideas of what the instruments could do:

Big bass: Large area attack around the musician

Snare drum: Small, high damage attacks that circle the musician

Cymbal: Knockback attack

Marimba: Attack buff

Steel drum: Defense buff

Tuba: Large long lasting hitbox

Trumpet: Small, slow projectiles that are shot in a spiral

Flute: Healing
